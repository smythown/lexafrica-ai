## 🌍 The Problem

**1.4 billion Africans** lack access to legal services. Legal help costs $100-500 per consultation — **unaffordable for 85% of the population**. Language barriers, low literacy, and geographic isolation make it worse.

**Result:** People lose their rights, get exploited, and have no recourse.
